Henok can be used both for blogs and for sports and team websites. The theme has support for the Sportspress plugin, but also works well without it. Henok's default colors are white, black and yellow and the colors can be cusotmized to match your team colors. There is one main menu at the top of the page and several widget areas. 

== Description ==

Henok was designed in my team colors, but you can use the options in the customizer
to change the colors.
The theme also has options for lazy loading images and for social media share links.
Non minified CSS can be found inside the CSS source folder.
